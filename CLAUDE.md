# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Claude workflow template repository that provides comprehensive documentation patterns for AI-assisted development. It serves as a reference implementation for setting up effective Claude Code workflows in other projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains a single comprehensive template file:
- `CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md`: Master template containing patterns for CLAUDE.md files, development diaries, and AI agent orchestration

## Key Template Components

### 1. CLAUDE.md Template Structure
The template provides a standard format for project guidance files including:
- Project overview and architecture
- Development commands documentation
- Key development patterns
- Environment configuration
- Development diary practices

### 2. Development Diary System
Located in `.dev_diary/`, this system tracks:
- User requests and prompts
- Investigation findings
- Implementation attempts (including failures)
- Decision points and reasoning
- Test results and outcomes

### 3. AI Agent Patterns (Advanced)
For complex multi-component projects:
- Backend Agent: Handles server-side tasks
- Frontend Agent: Manages UI components
- Mobile Agent: Handles platform-specific code
- Architect Agent: Coordinates cross-component features

## Using This Template

To implement this template in a new project:

1. Copy relevant sections from `CLAUDE_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Customize based on project complexity:
   - Simple projects: Basic CLAUDE.md only
   - Medium projects: CLAUDE.md + dev_diary
   - Complex projects: Full implementation including agent patterns

3. Adapt to your specific tech stack and workflow needs

## Template Maintenance

This template should be updated when:
- New best practices emerge
- Common patterns are identified across projects
- Claude Code capabilities expand
