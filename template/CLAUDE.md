# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üöÄ First Time Setup

**IMPORTANT: If this is a new project created from the claude-template, please help me set it up by:**

1. **Asking me these questions:**
   - What is your project name?
   - What does this project do? (brief description)
   - What are the main development commands? (build, test, dev, lint)
   - What is your project structure?
   - Are there any specific patterns or conventions I should know about?

2. **Then update this file by:**
   - Replacing all `[placeholder]` sections with my actual project information
   - Filling in real commands, paths, and descriptions
   - Adding any project-specific guidance

3. **After setup is complete:**
   - Ask me: "Should I remove the First Time Setup section now that we're done?"
   - Only remove it if I confirm
   - The .dev_diary feature should ALWAYS be kept - it's the main feature of this template

Note: This template includes a development diary system in `.dev_diary/` for tracking implementation details and decisions. This is a core feature and should be preserved.

## Development Diary & Architecture Decision Records

### Development Diary Usage

Create a dev diary entry in `.dev_diary/` when:
- Starting a new feature or significant change
- Investigating a bug or unexpected behavior
- Trying multiple approaches to solve a problem
- Encountering errors that require research
- Learning something non-obvious about the codebase
- Documenting day-to-day development progress

The diary helps future development by preserving context and implementation details.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Create an ADR in `.dev_diary/adr/` when making decisions that:
- Affect the overall system architecture
- Involve choosing between multiple viable options
- Would be expensive to change later
- Future developers might question

ADRs document the "why" behind important technical decisions. See `.dev_diary/adr/README.md` for details.

## AI Agents for Parallel Development

This project includes specialized AI agents in `.claude/agents/` that enable parallel development workflows. Use the `/agents` command to work with them.

### Available Agents

#### üéØ Orchestrator (`orchestrator.md`)
Coordinates parallel development workflows and manages multi-agent collaboration. Use when:
- Breaking down complex features into parallel tasks
- Coordinating work across multiple agents
- Managing integration of completed work
- Tracking overall project progress

#### üìã Task Distributor (`task-distributor.md`)
Analyzes requirements and intelligently distributes tasks to specialized agents. Use when:
- Starting a new feature that needs task breakdown
- Identifying which agents should handle specific work
- Optimizing for parallel execution
- Managing task dependencies

#### üß™ Tester (`tester.md`)
Testing and QA specialist. Use when:
- Writing test cases
- Implementing test automation
- Performing quality assurance
- Validating functionality

#### üëÅÔ∏è Reviewer (`reviewer.md`)
Code review specialist. Use when:
- Reviewing code quality
- Checking security practices
- Validating performance
- Ensuring best practices

### Using Agents

1. **Single Agent**: Use `/agents` and select a specific agent for focused tasks
2. **Parallel Development**: Use the orchestrator to coordinate multiple agents
3. **Task Distribution**: Let the task-distributor analyze and assign work

### Example Workflows

#### Complex Feature Development
```
1. Use orchestrator to receive requirements
2. Orchestrator works with task-distributor to break down work
3. Multiple agents work on tasks in parallel
4. Tester validates functionality
5. Reviewer ensures code quality
6. Orchestrator integrates completed work
```

#### Testing Workflow
```
1. Use tester agent to design test strategy
2. Implement unit and integration tests
3. Run tests and analyze coverage
4. Report findings and suggestions
```

#### Code Review Process
```
1. Use reviewer agent after implementation
2. Check for best practices and security
3. Suggest improvements
4. Validate fixes
```

These agents are designed to work together efficiently, enabling true parallel development while maintaining code quality and consistency.
