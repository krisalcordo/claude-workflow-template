# Development Diary

This directory contains development notes and implementation details that help future developers (and Claude) understand the evolution of this project.

## When to Create an Entry

Create a diary entry when:
- Implementing complex features that require multiple iterations
- Investigating bugs or performance issues
- Making architectural decisions
- Trying approaches that don't work (document why they failed)
- Solving problems in non-obvious ways

## How to Use

1. Copy `template.md` to a new file with format: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
2. Fill in the sections that apply to your work
3. Delete sections you don't need
4. Be specific about what you tried and why

## Entry Naming

```
YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md
```

Examples:
- `2024-03-15-auth-system-design.md`
- `2024-03-16-websocket-debugging.md`
- `2024-03-17-performance-optimization.md`

## Best Practices

- **Be Honest**: Document what didn't work and why
- **Include Context**: Explain why decisions were made
- **Show Code**: Include relevant code snippets
- **Link Resources**: Reference helpful articles or docs
- **Think Future**: Write for someone (or Claude) reading this months later

## What Makes a Good Entry

Good entries include:
- Clear problem statement
- Approaches attempted (even failed ones)
- Final solution with reasoning
- Lessons learned
- Future considerations

Remember: The goal is to capture knowledge that would otherwise be lost, making the codebase more maintainable and understandable.
