# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Status**: accepted

## Context

In any software project, we make many decisions that affect the architecture and overall structure of the system. These decisions are often made after careful consideration of trade-offs, but the reasoning behind them can be lost over time as:

- Team members change
- Memory fades
- Context is forgotten
- The codebase evolves

Without documentation of these decisions, future developers (including our future selves and AI assistants like Claude) may:
- Question why certain approaches were taken
- Accidentally reverse important decisions
- Spend time re-investigating already-solved problems
- Make conflicting architectural choices

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions in this project.

ADRs will:
- Be stored in `.dev_diary/adr/` directory
- Follow the template provided in `template.md`
- Be numbered sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Be immutable once accepted (changes require new ADRs)
- Focus on "why" rather than "how"

## Consequences

### Positive
- Future developers understand the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Decisions are made more thoughtfully when they must be documented
- Onboarding new team members becomes easier
- AI assistants like Claude have context for maintaining architectural consistency
- Prevents repeating past investigations

### Negative
- Requires discipline to write ADRs for significant decisions
- Adds a small amount of overhead to the decision-making process
- May feel unnecessary for small projects initially

### Neutral
- ADRs become part of the project's permanent documentation
- The collection of ADRs tells the story of the project's architectural evolution
- ADRs complement, rather than replace, other forms of documentation
